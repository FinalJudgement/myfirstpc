        <h2>Why would you want to build a PC?</h2>
        <p>
            Building computers can be one of the most satisfying and fulfilling accomplishments
            that one can achieve. In this day and age where technology is always evolving,
            building yourself a computer can save you both time and money. here are some
            of the benefits you can expect from building your first computer.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A high-performance computer for a lower cost</li>
            <li>Interchangeable PC parts to keep your computer relevant</li>
            <li>Overall Longevity of your PC's lifespan</li>
            <li>Lights... very awesome, cool, glowy lights</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Just to name a few.
        </p>
        <img class='hpImg' src="img1.jpg" alt="Corsair Liquid Cooling">
        <p>
            Now you might be thinking, lights? who the heck cares about lights? Well, I
            was just kidding about the lights part. The truth is you don't need them... but
            you should get them anyway because they make your computer look like a
            spaceship and let's be honest. Everyone loves spaceships!
        </p>
        <img class='hpImg' src="img2.jpg" alt="dual monitor PC setup">

        <p>
            Seriously though, maybe you've found yourself wondering why you're unable
            to play the new game that was just released because the screen keeps stuttering.
            Maybe your favorite game keeps crashing and shutting down when you fight
            the first boss. Maybe your computer runs extremely slow every time you try to
            launch <span class="italictext boldtext">Microsoft Word</span>, <span class="italictext boldtext">Google
                Chrome</span>, and your antivirus at the same time.
            or maybe your computer runs hot enough to bake grandma's pot roast for dinner
            tomorrow. Building a PC can help solve many of these problems so you
            can focus on what truly matters to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now don't get me wrong. Just because you are building a computer doesn't
            mean it needs to be a high-end gaming rig. you can build a computer to meet
            your personal needs. best of all it's not too hard to get started. Here at My
            First PC, we want to make your PC building experience as seamless as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I get started?</h2>
        <p>
            I've put together a couple of websites to help you decide on the PC parts you'll
            need to get your computer up and running!
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li><a style="color:red;" href="https://www.newegg.com">Visit newegg</a></li>
            <li><a style="color:red;" href="https://www.pcpartpicker.com">Visit PC Part Picker</a></li>
            <li><a style="color:red;" href="https://www.microcenter.com">Visit Micro Center</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Below I've listed the required components you'll need for your computer, as well
            as some quality components that may make your life a little easier!
        </p>
        <h2>Required PC Parts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tower/Case</li>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>CPU Processor</li>
            <li>GPU Graphics Card</li>
            <li>Ram Memory</li>
            <li>Storage (HD or SSD)</li>
            <li>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</li>
            <li>Case Cooling Fans (The light up ones :D)</li>
            <li>Monitor, Mouse, and Keyboard</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tower/Case</h3>
        <p>
            The Tower is the casing that you'll need to house all of your computer components
            the prices vary from anywhere as low as $30 to $150+. The case that you choose
            can affect how cool your computer runs during high and low load times. you can
            save money on this part but I wouldn't recommend going too cheap. I find that the
            saying <span class="italictext">"You get what you pay for"</span> goes a long way in the technology
            industry.
        </p>

        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <p>Next, you'll need a Motherboard. Motherboards connect all your computer components
            together. they help each individual part communicate with one another. when you
            first install the motherboard into the case and start plugging computer components
            into the motherboard, it should remind you of legos. just be sure you handle it with
            care as they can be <span class="boldtext">sensitive to damage</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>CPU Processor</h3>
        <p>
            Now onto the famous Processor. if computers were people, you could think of the
            CPU as the brain. The processor communicates and interacts with all the different
            hardware components you install in your computer, as well as runs necessary
            processes that create the beautiful user interface, and interactability that computers
            are known for. without the processor, there is no <span class="boldtext">Windows Operating
                System</span>, no
            video games, no <span class="boldtext">Google Chrome</span>, nothing! The Processors I recommend are
            going
            to be
            an <span class="boldtext">Intel Processor</span> or an <span class="boldtext">AMD Processor</span>.
            I will
            also note that I typically match
            my <span class="boldtext">Intel CPU</span> with an <span class="boldtext">Nvidia GPU</span>, or
            <span class="boldtext">AMD CPU</span>, with an <span class="boldtext">AMD GPU</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>GPU Graphics Card</h3>
        <p>
            Now comes my favorite, the GPU! for the most part, you have two major options
            to choose from. <a style="color:red;" href=" https://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia graphics card</a>, or
            <a style="color: red;" href=" https://www.amd.com">AMD graphics card</a>. graphic cards are
            used for anything that requires heavy graphics rendering. great for your
            gamers, graphic designers, and video editors. Installing one of these bad boys
            is sure to make your friends jealous! you could even mine some bitcoin with
            it if you're feeling nerdy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="boldtext italictext">
                Note: I recommend that you pair your AMD CPU with AMD GPU and Intel CPU
                with Nvidia GPU</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>RAM Memory</h3>
        <p>
            RAM or <span class="boldtext italictext">Random Access Memory</span> is another important component
            you'll
            need
            to install.
            Don't worry, this one is pretty easy. RAM is the memory that is flexible and could be used
            by programs to perform quick data changes that your programs need to run smoothly.
            if you want to multi-task and have tons of internet windows open while running
            your favorite video game, while simultaneously referencing with a 3rd party software
            your RAM is how you want to do it. RAM Typically comes with memory sizes of 8GB,
            16GB, or 32GB. if you're not a big gamer I'd recommend 16GB max. However, if you
            love Playing <span class="boldtext">Red Dead Redemption</span>, watching your favorite live stream
            on
            twitch,
            and
            referencing <span class="boldtext">Game Faq</span> walkthrough on <span class="boldtext">Google
                Chrome</span>
            all at the same time. I'd
            recommend 16GB minimum.

        </p>
        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
            Your storage is where all the files, programs, and documents you download and install
            are stored. including the <span class="boldtext">operating system <span class="italictext">(Windows,
                    Linux)</span></span>. For your storage, you also
            have 2 options to choose from. <span class="boldtext">HDD <span class="italictext">(Hard
                    Drive)</span></span>, and
            <span class="boldtext">SSD <span class="italictext">(Solid State Drive)</span></span>
            . The HHD
            is the older type of memory storage and is typically slower, but is still purchased
            due to its large storage capacity. The SSD is the newer much faster brother of the
            HDD and comes with a higher cost, and for good reason. with one of these SSD bad boys
            installed in your PC, you can expect your computer to go from being completely off to
            the desktop home screen and ready for use in literal seconds. now that's fast. If you
            can afford it I definitely recommend the SSD, but it's not necessary if you're trying
            to save money. Although, I would consider cutting costs from a different component.
        </p>
        <h3>PSU</h3>
        <p>
            Next on the list is the <span class="boldtext">Power Supply Unit</span>. This one is a little tricky
            because
            every power supply offers different voltages, and every computer depending on
            the hardware you install requires different amounts of power. For this guide
            I won't go in-depth regarding this. but if you find yourself in a PC hardware
            store like microcenter, I definitely recommend that you speak with one of there
            PC part specialist for further assistance. with that being said, PSU's usually have
            a grading on their efficiency, which could be Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum.
            If you're trying to save money, there's nothing wrong with the Bronze efficiency
            PSU, but you want to make sure that it provides enough voltage to effectively power
            your PC components. Especially your GPU, CPU, and Motherboard.
        </p>
        <h3>Case Cooling Fans</h3>
        <p>
            You knew it was coming, the glowy light-up fans! the fans don't really need to
            light up. Most PC builders buy them because they like the aesthetic, but plain
            non-light-up fans do the trick just as good. Fans provide airflow for Your
            PC to help keep everything running as cool as possible. installing these is pretty
            easy, you'll want to make sure the size of the fans matches the size of your case.
            going to a computer part store like microcenter can help you size up the fans
            to the case. Just make sure you get the Light-up ones :).
        </p>
        <h3>Monitor, Mouse, and Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
            For this part, you may already have a monitor, mouse, or keyboard. If you do, that's
            fine but if you're missing any of these, make sure you run and pick one up before
            you finish building your PC.
        </p>
        <h3>Operating System</h3>
        <p>
            Windows is constantly putting out Operating systems. if you already own a transferrable
            Windows operating system from an old PC you're getting rid of, then you don't need to
            buy one, but if you're not particularly tech-savvy, then I'd consider buying a fresh
            edition. I won't go into detail about transferring your operating system from one
            computer to another, but just know that it's possible.
