                Hello, and Welcome to My First PC. My name is Carlos. I created
                this website because I wanted to bridge the gap between PC building
                and your average consumer. My goal is to equip customers with
                the knowledge, and confidence to build their first PC which will
                save them money, and give them a product they're truly happy with.
            </p>

                My first PC is a brand new initiative that started with just
                one person, and by word of mouth had evolved into a small community
                of like-minded PC builders. and all of us are constantly sharing
                new information and technologies that are released to bring you
                the most up-to-date knowledge.

                before 2015 I remember always spending money on overpriced gaming
                laptops, and desktops. Meanwhile, I already had friends that were
                experimenting with changing out PC parts from their prebuilt desktops.
                At the time I remember feeling intimidated, and uncertain that I could
                build a desktop. I thought "You'd have to be a genius to do that" but
                after 2015 I realized just how easy it was, and found it to be very
                similar to the Legos, and K'nex toys that children play with growing up.
                When I saw the result of my labor, I realized I never wanted to
                buy a prebuilt desktop again.
