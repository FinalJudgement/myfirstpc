        <h2>Why would you want to build a PC?</h2>
        <p>
            Building a pc can be one of the most satisfying and fulfilling accomplishments
            <br>
            that one can achieve. In this day and age where technology is always evolving,
            <br>
            building yourself a computer can save you both time and money. here are some
            <br>
            of the benefits you can expect from building your first computer.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A high-performance computer for a lower cost</li>
            <li>Interchangeable pc parts to keep your pc relevant</li>
            <li>Overall Longevity of your PC's lifespan</li>
            <li>Lights... very awesome, cool, glowy lights</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Just to name a few.
        </p>

        <p>

            Now you might be thinking, lights? who the heck cares about lights? Well, I
            <br>
            was just kidding about the lights part. The truth is you don't need them... but
            <br>
            you should get them anyway because they make your computer look like a
            <br>
            spaceship and let's be honest. Everyone loves spaceships!
        </p>

        <p>
            Seriously though, maybe you've found yourself wondering why you're unable
            <br>
            to play the new game that was just released because the screen keeps stuttering.
            <br>
            Maybe your favorite game keeps crashing and shutting down when you fight
            <br>
            the first boss. Maybe your computer runs extremely slow every time you try to
            <br>
            launch Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, and your antivirus at the same time.
            <br>
            or maybe your computer runs hot enough to bake grandma's pot roast for dinner
            <br>
            tomorrow. Building your own pc can help solve many of these problems so you
            <br>
            can focus on what truly matters to you.

            Now don't get me wrong. Just because you are building a computer doesn't
            <br>
            mean it needs to be a high-end gaming rig. you can build a computer to meet
            <br>
            your personal needs. best of all it's not too hard to get started. Here at My
            <br>
            First PC, we want to make your pc building experience as seamless as possible.

        <h2>How can I get started?</h2>
        <p>
            I've put together a couple of websites to help you decide on the PC parts you'll
            <br>
            need to get your computer up and running!
            <br>

        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newegg.com">Visit newegg</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcpartpicker.com">Visit PC Part Picker</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.microcenter.com">Visit Micro Center</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Below I've listed the required components you'll need for your computer, as well
            <br>
            as some quality components that may make your life a little easier!
        </p>
        <h2>Required PC Parts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tower/Case</li>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>CPU Processor</li>
            <li>GPU Graphics Card</li>
            <li>Ram Memory</li>
            <li>Storage (HD or SSD)</li>
            <li>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</li>
            <li>Case Cooling Fans (The light up ones :D)</li>
            <li>Monitor, Mouse, and Keyboard</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tower/Case</h3>
        <p>
            The Tower is the casing that you'll need to house all of your computer components
            <br>
            the prices vary from anywhere as low as $30 to $150+. The case that you choose
            <br>
            can affect how cool your computer runs during high and low load times. you can
            <br>
            save money on this part but I wouldn't recommend going too cheap. I find that the
            <br>
            saying "You get what you pay for" goes a long way in the technology industry.
        </p>

        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <p>Next, you'll need a Motherboard. Motherboards connect all your computer components
            <br>
            together. they help each individual part communicate with one another. when you
            <br>
            first install the motherboard into the case and start plugging computer components
            <br>
            into the motherboard, it should remind you of legos. just be sure you handle it with
            <br>
            care as they can be sensitive to damage.
        </p>
        <h3>CPU Processor</h3>
        <p>
            Now onto the famous Processor. if computers were people, you could think of the
            <br>
            CPU as the brain. The processor communicates and interacts with all the different
            <br>
            hardware components you install in your computer, as well as runs necessary
            <br>
            processes that create the beautiful user interface, and interactability that computers
            <br>
            are known for. without the processor, there is no windows operating system, no
            <br>
            video games, no google chrome, nothing! The Processors I recommend are going to be
            <br>
            an Intel Processor, or an AMD processor. I will also note that I typcally match
            <br>
            my Intel CPU with an Nvidia GPU, or AMD CPU, with an AMD GPU.
        </p>
        <h3>GPU Graphics Card</h3>
        <p>
            Now comes my favorite, the GPU! for the most part, you have two major options
            <br>
            to choose from. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com">Nvidia graphics card</a>, or
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amd.com">AMD graphics card</a>. graphic cards are
            <br>
            used for anything that requires heavy graphics rendering. great for your
            <br>
            gamers, graphic designers, and video editors. Installing one of these bad boys
            <br>
            is sure to make your friends jealous! you could even mine some bitcoin with
            <br>
            it if you're feeling nerdy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Note: I recommend that you pair your AMD CPU with AMD GPU, and Intel CPU with</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>Nvidia GPU</strong>.


        </p>
        <h3>RAM Memory</h3>
        <p>
            RAM or Random Access Memory is another important component you'll need to install.
            <br>
            Don't worry, this one is pretty easy. RAM is the memory that is flexible and could be used
            <br>
            by programs to perform quick data changes that your programs need to run smoothly.
            <br>
            if you want to multi-task and have tons of internet windows open while running
            <br>
            your favorite video game, while simultaneously referencing with a 3rd party software
            <br>
            your RAM is how you want to do it. RAM Typically comes with memory sizes of 8GB,
            <br>
            16GB, or 32GB. if you're not a big gamer I'd recommend 16GB max. However, if you
            <br>
            love Playing Red Dead Redemption, watching your favorite live stream on twitch, and
            <br>
            referencing Game Faq walkthrough on google chrome all at the same time. I'd
            <br>
            recommend 16GB minimum.

        </p>
        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
            Your storage is where all the files, programs, and documents you download and install
            <br>
            are stored. including the operating system (Windows, Linux). For your storage, you also
            <br>
            have 2 options to choose from. HDD (Hard Drive), and SSD (Solid State Drive). The HHD
            <br>
            is the older type of memory storage and is typically slower, but is still purchased
            <br>
            due to its large storage capacity. The SSD is the newer much faster brother of the
            <br>
            HDD and comes with a higher cost, and for good reason. with one of these SSD bad boys
            <br>
            installed in your PC, you can expect your computer to go from being completely off to
            <br>
            the desktop home screen and ready for use in literal seconds. now that's fast. If you
            <br>
            can afford it I definitely recommend the SSD, but it's not necessary if you're trying
            <br>
            to save money. Although, I would consider cutting costs from a different component.
        </p>
        <h3>PSU</h3>
        <p>
            Next on the list is the Power Supply Unit. This one is a little tricky because
            <br>
            every power supply offers different voltages, and every computer depending on
            <br>
            the hardware you install requires different amounts of power. For this guide
            <br>
            I won't go in-depth regarding this. but if you find yourself in a pc hardware
            <br>
            store like microcenter, I definitely recommend that you speak with one of there
            <br>
            PC part specialist for further assistance. with that being said, PSU's usually have
            <br>
            a grading on their efficiency, which could be Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum.
            <br>
            If you're trying to save money, there's nothing wrong with the Bronze efficiency
            <br>
            PSU, but you want to make sure that it provides enough voltage to effectively power
            <br>
            your PC components. Especially your GPU, CPU, and Motherboard.
        </p>
        <h3>Case Cooling Fans</h3>
        <p>
            You knew it was coming, the glowy light-up fans! the fans don't really need to
            <br>
            light-up. Most PC builders buy them because they like the aesthetic, but plain
            <br>
            non-light-up fans do the trick just as good. Fans provide airflow for Your
            <br>
            PC to help keep everything running as cool as possible. installing these is pretty
            <br>
            easy, you'll want to make sure the size of the fans matches the size of your case.
            <br>
            going to a computer part store like microcenter can help you size up the fans
            <br>
            to the case. Just make sure you get the Light-up ones :).
        </p>
        <h3>Monitor, Mouse, and Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
            For this part, you may already have a monitor, mouse, or keyboard. If you do, that's
            <br>
            fine but if you're missing any of these, make sure you run and pick one up before
            <br>
            you finish building your PC.
        </p>
        <h3>operating System</h3>
        <p>
            Windows is constantly putting out Operating systems. if you already own a transferrable
            <br>
            Windows operating system from an old pc you're getting rid of, then you don't need to
            <br>
            buy one, but if you're not particularly tech savvy, then I'd consider buying a fresh
            <br>
            edition. I won't go into detail about transferring your operating system from one
            <br>
            computer to another, but just know that it's possible.
        </p>

        <p id="conclusion">
            This concludes the information for the PC parts, We will be releasing further updates
            <br>
            in the future, including a step-by-step guide on how to put everything together.
